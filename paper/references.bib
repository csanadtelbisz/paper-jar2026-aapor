Many variants of CEGAR have been developed over the years as different problem domains usually require different strategies for efficient verification. This has lead to generic and configurable CEGAR frameworks, which can incorporate various algorithms. In our paper we propose six novel improvements to different aspects of the CEGAR approach, including both abstraction and refinement. We implement our new contributions in the Theta framework allowing us to compare them with state-of-the-art algorithms. We conduct an experiment on a diverse set of models to address research questions related to the effectiveness and efficiency of our new strategies. Results show that our new contributions perform well in general. Moreover, we highlight certain cases where performance could not be increased or where a remarkable improvement is achieved.},

Successful toolchains tackle the problem of parsing a wide range of inputs in an efficient way by reusing solutions from existing compiler technologies such as Eclipse CDT or LLVM. Our experience suggests that well-established techniques in compiler technology are not necessarily beneficial to model checkers and sometimes can even hurt their performance. In this paper, we review the tools mature enough to participate in the Software Verification Competition in terms of the employed analysis and frontend techniques. We find that successful tools do exhibit a bias toward certain combinations. We explore the theoretical reasons and suggest an adaptable approach for model checking frameworks. We validate our recommendations by implementing a new frontend for a model checking framework and show that it indeed benefits some of the algorithms.},
